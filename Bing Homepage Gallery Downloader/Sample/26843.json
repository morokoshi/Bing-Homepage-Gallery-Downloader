We’re spending this week in Death Valley National Park, stopping first here at the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, the most easily accessed dunes in the park.","Are we insane to explore Death Valley in summertime? After all, this is the place with the highest recorded temperature of anywhere on the planet. And recently, high temps have been hovering around 120 degrees. How should we prepare? Sure, we’ll bring plenty of water. But right now, we’re thinking a sweet frozen treat might be just the thing.","What’s your favorite iced delight? Are you a soft serve partisan? Prefer ice cream sandwiches? Mexican paletas? Let us know on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, where we'll be posting regular updates on our national parks road trip. And don't forget to check back on the Bing homepage each Friday to see our favorite photo from the park we’ll be visiting that week. Next up: North to Oregon’s Crater Lake National Park."]}
